<h4 align='center'> Project Description </h4> 
This project aimed to imitate the functionality of Google's Flight Booking System. An artificial flight dataset was created manually which was later queried for searching and booking with the help of JDBC and MySQL. Queries were performed based on the user preferences specified through the designed Graphical User Interface (GUI). <br><br>
